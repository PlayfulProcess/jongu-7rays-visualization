# Seven Rays Vector Space Explorer

**Interactive exploration of Alice Bailey's Seven Rays and Seven Planes through learned vector embeddings**

This Hugging Face Space transforms esoteric teachings into a navigable vector space where you can discover hidden relationships and explore consciousness development through machine learning.

## ðŸŽ¯ What This Does

- **Combines** knowledge graph embeddings (structural relationships) + text embeddings (semantic meaning)
- **Visualizes** the resulting vector space in 2D/3D with meaningful clustering
- **Enables** semantic search ("what's similar to Ray 4?") and vector arithmetic
- **Highlights** the Fourth Ray/Plane as bridge functions between spirit and matter

## ðŸš€ Quick Start

1. **Explore the Visualization**: See how rays, planes, and qualities cluster in learned vector space
2. **Try Semantic Search**: Search for "harmony", "bridge", "consciousness" to find related concepts  
3. **Vector Math**: Try "Ray 4" + "Buddhic Plane" to discover what emerges from that combination
4. **Fourth Emphasis**: Toggle highlighting to see humanity's mediating role

## ðŸ”¬ The Machine Learning

- **PyKEEN TransE**: Learns embeddings from knowledge graph of ray-plane relationships
- **SentenceTransformers**: Encodes textual descriptions of each concept
- **Weighted Fusion**: Combines structural + semantic understanding (adjustable Î± parameter)
- **UMAP**: Projects high-dimensional vectors into explorable 2D/3D space

## ðŸ§­ Expected Discoveries

- **Natural Clustering**: Love-oriented rays (2,4,6) might cluster together
- **Bridge Points**: Ray 4 equidistant from spiritual and material clusters  
- **Evolution Paths**: Clear vectors showing consciousness development
- **Hidden Connections**: Relationships not explicitly stated in Bailey's texts

## ðŸ“š Data Sources

Built from Alice Bailey's complete works:
- A Treatise on the Seven Rays (5 volumes)
- Esoteric Psychology I & II  
- A Treatise on Cosmic Fire

**Note**: This is an experimental contemplative tool, not definitive teaching. The vector space represents learned patterns from source material for exploration and insight.
