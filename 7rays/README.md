# Seven Rays & Seven Planes Interactive Visualization

An interactive web visualization exploring the dynamic relationships between the Seven Rays (divine qualities) and Seven Planes (levels of consciousness) according to Alice Bailey's esoteric teachings.

## Overview

This project represents an experiment in visualizing complex esoteric relationships through interactive web technology. Unlike static correspondence charts, this visualization emphasizes the **dynamic, living nature** of these spiritual energies and their relationships.

## Key Features

### üåü Dynamic Relationship Matrix
- No static 1:1 mappings between rays and planes
- Relationships change based on evolutionary context and consciousness level
- Interactive exploration of connection strengths and types

### üé® Meaningful Color Visualization
- Ray colors based on traditional esoteric associations
- Plane colors representing different levels of consciousness
- Dynamic color blending showing interaction qualities

### üîÑ Fourth Emphasis
- Special highlighting of 4th Ray (Harmony through Conflict) and 4th Plane (Buddhic/Intuitional)
- Represents humanity's role as bridge between spiritual and material realms

### üìä Multiple View Modes
- **Circular Ray Display**: Shows the seven rays as divine qualities
- **Vertical Plane Display**: Hierarchical arrangement from spirit to matter
- **Relationship Matrix**: Interactive grid showing all ray-plane connections

### üéõÔ∏è Context Controls
- **Evolutionary Context**: Human, Spiritual, Animal kingdom perspectives
- **Cycle Phases**: Outgoing (manifestation) vs. Incoming (spiritualization)
- **Animation**: Pulse effects for strong relationships

## Technical Implementation

### Frontend Stack
- **Vanilla HTML/CSS/JavaScript** - Simple, no framework dependencies
- **D3.js** - For sophisticated data visualization
- **Responsive Design** - Works on desktop and mobile

### Data Processing
- **Python Scripts** - For extracting and analyzing esoteric relationships
- **JSON Data** - Structured storage of rays, planes, and relationships
- **Dynamic Calculations** - Real-time relationship strength computation

### Files Structure
```

‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ index.html              # Main visualization interface
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ visualization.js        # D3.js visualization logic
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ vercel.json            # Deployment configuration
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ extract_meanings.py    # Extract ray/plane definitions

```

## Local Development

1. **Generate Data**:
   ```bash
   python extract_meanings.py
   python relationship_analyzer.py
   ```

2. **View Locally**:
   Open `index.html` in a modern web browser, or use a local server:
   ```bash
   python -m http.server 8000
   # Then visit http://localhost:8000
   ```

## Deployment

### Vercel (Recommended)
```bash
# Install Vercel CLI
npm i -g vercel

# Deploy
vercel
```

### Alternative Static Hosts
- **GitHub Pages**: Push to a repository and enable Pages
- **Netlify**: Drag and drop the folder to Netlify dashboard
- **Any HTTP Server**: The project is pure static files

## Philosophical Approach

This visualization is built on several key principles:

### 1. **No Static Correspondences**
Unlike traditional esoteric charts that show fixed relationships, this system recognizes that ray-plane interactions are **contextual and evolutionary**. A 5th ray soul might express through different planes at different stages of development.

### 2. **Fourth Kingdom Emphasis**
Special attention to humanity as the "4th kingdom" - the bridge between animal instinct and spiritual intuition. The 4th ray and 4th plane receive enhanced visualization to represent this crucial mediating function.

### 3. **Dynamic Rather Than Dogmatic**
The system avoids presenting any single "correct" mapping, instead showing how relationships **shift and flow** based on consciousness level, evolutionary stage, and cosmic cycles.

### 4. **Multi-Modal Representation**
Each relationship can be expressed through:
- **Visual**: Color blending and intensity
- **Spatial**: Geometric arrangements and proximity
- **Interactive**: Hover effects and click exploration
- **Temporal**: Animation showing relationship dynamics

## Data Sources

The relationships and definitions are based on:
- Alice Bailey's "Treatise on the Seven Rays" (5 volumes)
- "Esoteric Psychology" volumes 1 & 2
- "A Treatise on Cosmic Fire"
- Traditional Theosophical teachings

However, the **interpretations and relationship calculations are experimental** - designed to stimulate insight rather than provide definitive answers.

## Future Enhancements

### Phase 2 Possibilities
- **Audio Sonification**: Each ray-plane relationship could generate harmonic frequencies
- **3D Visualization**: WebGL/Three.js for spatial relationship exploration  
- **Historical Context**: Show how relationships have shifted over different ages
- **Personal Ray Analysis**: Input personal ray structure and see emphasized relationships

### Phase 3 Advanced Features
- **Collaborative Exploration**: Multi-user synchronized exploration
- **AI-Assisted Insights**: Natural language explanations of relationship patterns
- **Integration with Astrological Data**: Planetary cycles affecting ray-plane emphasis
- **Mobile AR**: Augmented reality visualization of ray-plane interactions
